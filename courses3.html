<h1>SELF AWARENESS</h1>
<p> 
    Self-awareness is the experience of one's own personality or individuality. It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of quality. While consciousness is being aware of one's environment and body and lifestyle, self-awareness is the recognition of that awareness.Self-awareness is how an individual consciously knows and understands their own character, feelings, motives, and desires. There are two broad categories of self-awareness: internal self-awareness and external self-awareness.
