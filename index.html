            <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
            <p>Social awareness is a crucial element of a childâ€™s education. It enables a student to consider the perspective of other people and understand their needs. Social awareness helps children in improving their social skills by interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.

                Students who are socially aware can recognize the resources available and use them to address the needs of society. It also reflects in their behaviour in the classroom and creates an environment that is ideal for learning. It teaches the skills of communication, collaboration, social responsibility, and professionalism, which are helpful in their professional life.</p>
