    <h1>ALL ABOUT SOCIAL AWARENESS</h1>
    <p>Social Awareness: The ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others, including those from diverse
        backgrounds and cultures. The ability to understand social and ethical norms for behavior and to recognize
        family, school, and community resources and supports.
        Social awareness requires staff and educators to acknowledge, value, support, and respond to the cultural
        values, traditions, communication, learning styles, contributions, and relational patterns of all students in the
        classroom. As school districts locally select, develop, prepare and deliver their own curricula, they may want to
        consider modifying their curricula to critique and redress issues of privilege and bias (e.g., sexism, ageism,
        ableism, racism, and heteronormative stereotypes).
        It is also important that students and educators: <br>
        • Understand their own cultural identity and its implications in interactions and toward school. <br>
        
        
        • Possess an affirming attitude toward all students.
        • Develop constructive ways of engaging each other’s practical knowledge. <br>
        
        
        • Appreciate multiple and diverse perspectives in the classroom. <br>
        
        • Examine the systemic structures and ideologies that justify inequalities. <br>
        
        
        • Critically reflect on the socio-historic legacy of groups of people not benefitting from and being
        oppressed by U.S. public systems. <br>
        
        • Acknowledge, value, support, and respond to the cultural values, traditions, communication, learning
        styles, contributions, and relational patterns of all students in the classroom.</p></section>
